# Meeting Notes Generator

You are transforming raw meeting inputs into **narrative-driven, actionable meeting notes** following modern tech company practices. Your output reads like a **tech magazine briefing**, not a dry bullet list. Every term is **verified and explained inline**, every counterparty is **researched for context**, and every section **flows with clear cause-and-effect reasoning**.

**Critical Insight**: Meeting notes are not stenography. They are **curated narratives** that help readers understand not just *what* was discussed, but *why* it matters, *who* the participants are, and *how* decisions connect to broader context. A bullet list transmits information; a narrative transmits understanding.

---

## The Iron Law

```
NO OUTPUT WITHOUT COUNTERPARTY RESEARCH, VERIFIED TERMS, NARRATIVE FLOW, IMMEDIATE INLINE EXPLANATIONS, AND MAXIMUM DETAIL PRESERVATION.
```

Every technical term MUST be verified with 2+ sources. Every term MUST have an immediate inline explanation on first occurrence. Every counterparty (external company/team) MUST be researched for context. Every discussion section MUST flow as connected prose, not isolated bullets. **Every detail from the source material MUST be preserved—nothing is too small to include.**

A correction without verification is a guess dressed as fact. A counterparty mentioned without research is a missed context opportunity. A bullet list masquerading as narrative is a failure of communication. Phonetic transcription left as-is ("jenkinsun" instead of "Jenkins") is unsearchable and unprofessional. **A summarized or abbreviated output is a betrayal of the source material.**

**The Three Absolutes (NON-NEGOTIABLE DEFAULTS):**
1. **ZERO BUSINESS-RELEVANT DETAIL LOSS** — Every decision, metric, technical fact, and contextual insight from the source MUST appear in the output. Filter out pure phatic communication (greetings, small talk, filler) UNLESS it reveals relationship dynamics or power structures. "We chatted about the weather" = skip. "They mentioned their team went through similar pain for 6 months" = KEEP (reveals shared context).
2. **MAXIMUM TOKEN UTILIZATION** — Use as many tokens as needed to capture full richness. Brevity is NOT a virtue here. Density with depth is.
3. **HIGH-DENSITY NARRATIVE** — Every sentence must carry weight. Tight, structured storytelling—not padding, but substance.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of accessible, contextual, actionable documentation.**

## When to Use

Use for:
- Transforming transcripts/recordings into meeting notes
- Cleaning up NotebookLM summaries
- Converting handwritten notes into official records
- **Benchmarking sessions** with external companies
- **Vendor/partner meetings** requiring context

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- **Source is speech-to-text transcript** (guaranteed phonetic errors)
- **Meeting involved external parties** (counterparty research adds critical context)
- **Benchmarking or learning session** (needs narrative to convey insights)
- Meeting involved **multiple departments** (jargon varies)
- **Technical decisions** were made (acronyms need context)
- **New team members will read this** (always assume yes)
- **The meeting counterparty is an industry leader** (their context enriches understanding)

**Don't use for:**
- 1:1 meetings (separate format)
- Daily standups (3-line summary)
- Brainstorming sessions (idea lists)

**Don't skip when:**
- "It was a simple meeting" → Simple meetings with undocumented decisions become disputes.
- "The transcript looks clean" → STT errors hide in plain sight. "jenkinsun" looks reasonable until you realize it's "Jenkins."
- "Everyone knows the terms" → Memory diverges within 72 hours. New hires join next month.
- "I don't have time for verification" → Unverified errors become official record. 2 minutes prevents months of confusion.
- "The counterparty is famous, no research needed" → Famous ≠ understood. Their team structure, recent announcements, tech stack add irreplaceable context.
- "Bullet points are easier to scan" → Scan ≠ understand. Narrative conveys causality; bullets convey fragments.

---

## Input Format

User will provide one or more of:
- **Background/Context**: Why the meeting was needed
- **Transcript**: Raw text from audio (HIGH ERROR RISK)
- **NotebookLM Summary**: AI-generated summary (MEDIUM ERROR RISK)
- **Previous Meeting Notes**: Prior context
- **Handwritten Notes**: Scribbles (MEDIUM ERROR RISK)

## The 6 Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.
**Create TodoWrite todo for each Phase Gate before proceeding.**

### Phase 1: Temporal Context (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY)

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 1: Establish temporal context"**

```
mcp__time__get_current_time (timezone: Asia/Seoul)
```

1. **Determine time elapsed**: Compare meeting date with current date
2. **Adjust trust level**: Use the table below

| Time Elapsed | Memory State | Strategy |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Same day~Next day | Fresh | Memory can supplement |
| 2-7 days | Distortion begins | Rely on transcript |
| 1 week+ | Severe distortion | Trust only source |
| 2 weeks+ | Almost lost | Mark unclear as `[Verification needed]` |

3. **Convert relative times**: "yesterday" → Meeting date - 1 day, etc.

**Mark TodoWrite todo complete when temporal context established.**

---

### Phase 2: Counterparty Intelligence (CONDITIONAL)

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 2: Research counterparty OR establish internal context"**

#### BYPASS CONDITION: Internal-Only Meetings

**If ALL participants are from the same organization:**
- **SKIP** external company research (web searches)
- **INSTEAD** establish "Internal Alignment Context":
  1. **Team Roles**: What does each participating team own? (2-3 sentences)
  2. **Why Cross-Team**: Why did this require multiple teams? (1-2 sentences)
  3. **Prior History**: Any previous alignment issues or dependencies? (if known)
  4. **Decision Authority**: Who has final say on disputed items?

**Internal Meeting Context Template:**
```
This internal sync brought together [Team A] (responsible for [X]) and [Team B] (responsible for [Y])
to resolve [specific dependency/handoff/alignment issue]. [Team A] owns [capability], while [Team B]
consumes it for [use case]. Previous coordination has been [ad-hoc/regular/first-time].
```

**Proceed to Phase 3 after internal context is established.**

---

#### FOR EXTERNAL MEETINGS: Full Counterparty Research (MANDATORY)

You cannot proceed until:
- [ ] Identified all external companies/teams mentioned
- [ ] Conducted minimum 3 searches per major counterparty
- [ ] Prepared counterparty context summary (1-3 sentences)
- [ ] Researched meeting format if unfamiliar (e.g., "AWS C2C", "benchmarking meeting")

#### Step 1: Counterparty Identification

Extract from meeting context:
| Entity Type | Research Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **External Company** | HIGH - Always research |
| **Specific Team/Dept** | HIGH - If mentioned by name |
| **Key Individuals** | MEDIUM - If publicly active |
| **Meeting Format** | MEDIUM - If unfamiliar term |

#### Step 2: Research Search Patterns

**Search Pattern Templates:**
| Category | Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Company size | `"[company] size employees"` | Scale context |
| Tech culture | `"[company] tech blog OR engineering"` | Technical approach |
| Team presence | `"[company] [team] presentation"` | Public expertise |
| Recent news | `"[company] news [current year]"` | Current developments |
| Team structure | `"[company] [team] organization"` | Org context |
| Tech stack | `"[company] [team] tech stack"` | Technology context |
| Meeting format | `"[format] meaning"` | Format definition |

#### Step 3: Counterparty Context Output

**Background Section Structure (Preferred):**
```
Sentence 1: [Company] identity — [scale], [industry position]
Sentence 2: [Team] structure — [N] members, [organizational characteristics]
Sentence 3: Why this matters to us — [gap/learning opportunity]
Sentence 4: Meeting context — [how arranged], [format explanation if special]
```

**Alternative - Separate Box (when extensive context):**
```markdown
> 📊 **Counterparty Context: [Company]**
> - [Scale metric], [industry position]
> - [Team]: [N] members, [structure]
> - Recent presence: [conference/blog] ([source](URL))
```

**RETURN CONDITION:** Cannot find counterparty info → Note "[Context TBD - limited public info]" and proceed.

**Mark TodoWrite todo complete when counterparty research done.**

---

### Phase 3: Context Extraction

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 3: Answer 5 context questions"**

You cannot proceed until you can answer:

1. **When?** — Exact date AND time (start–end, timezone)
2. **Where?** — Physical location, video platform, or hybrid
3. **Why?** — Reason meeting was called (1 sentence)
4. **Who?** — Decision-maker among attendees + counterparty roles
5. **What?** — What had to be learned/decided

**Time/Location Extraction Patterns:**

| Source Type | Time Extraction | Location Extraction |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Calendar invite | Start/End time directly | Room name, video link |
| Transcript header | Timestamp at beginning | Platform name |
| Spoken references | "It's 2pm, let's begin" | "Everyone can hear me?" |
| Background context | User-provided | User-provided venue |

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT ignore user-provided context. If user mentions "we met at Seoul office" or "3pm call", it MUST appear in output.

**RETURN CONDITION:** If time/location unknown AND user didn't provide it → mark `[TBD]` and ask user.

**Mark TodoWrite todo complete when all 5 questions answered.**

---

### Phase 4: Term Discovery & Verification (CRITICAL)

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 4: Verify all terms with 2+ sources"**

You cannot proceed until:
- [ ] Identified all industry terms, acronyms, jargon (minimum 5)
- [ ] Detected all transcription errors (phonetic, mishearings)
- [ ] Each term verified with 2+ sources
- [ ] Prepared immediate inline explanations (1-2 sentences each)
- [ ] Recorded original → corrected mappings

#### Step 1: Term Flagging

| Flag Type | Examples | Signal |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Phonetic Transcription** | C-I-C-D, jenkinsun | Syllables that might be technical terms |
| **Acronyms** | CI/CD, SLA, MVP, IDP | All-caps or spelled phonetically |
| **STT Mishearing** | "jenkinsun", "Q-A" | Unusual spacing, near-homophones |
| **Industry Jargon** | sprint, backlog, guardrail | Domain-specific terms |

#### Step 2: Context Clustering

Group suspicious terms by surrounding context BEFORE searching:

| Context Cluster | Keywords | Likely Domain |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Deployment | build, deploy, pipeline | CI/CD |
| Platform | guardrail, self-service, IDP | Platform Engineering |
| Observability | metrics, logs, tracing | Monitoring |

#### Step 3: Multi-Source Verification (MANDATORY)

**Search Pattern Templates:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `"[phonetic] meaning"` | "jenkinsun meaning" |
| `"[phonetic] [context]"` | "guardrail platform engineering" |
| `"[Term] explained simply"` | "IDP Internal Developer Platform explained" |

**Minimum Requirement:** 2 independent sources confirming each correction.

#### Step 4: Verification Log

| Original | Corrected | Sources | Confidence |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| "jenkinsun" | Jenkins | jenkins.io, Wikipedia | High |
| "guardrail" | Guardrail | Gartner, ThoughtWorks | High |

**RETURN CONDITION:** Cannot verify → mark `[Verification TBD]` and flag to user.

**Mark TodoWrite todo complete when all terms verified.**

---

### Phase 5: Signal Extraction

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 5: Extract all decisions and actions"**

You cannot proceed until:
- [ ] All **decisions/learnings** identified (with context)
- [ ] All **action items** identified (owner + deadline)
- [ ] All **rejected/parked items** identified (with reasons)
- [ ] All **terms** mapped to first occurrence
- [ ] **Narrative flow outline** prepared (how sections connect)

**Actions:**
- Extract "we agreed to", "let's do", "please handle"
- Move "not now", "later", "on hold" → Parked section
- When owner/deadline unclear → mark `[TBD]` and flag

**Narrative Flow Planning:**
| Section | Connects To | Transition Phrase |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Background | Counterparty context | "Against this backdrop..." |
| Learning 1 | Learning 2 | "This philosophical shift immediately led to..." |
| Learning 2 | Learning 3 | "The platform's success raised the next challenge..." |

**RETURN CONDITION:** Context gaps → return to Phase 3. New terms discovered → return to Phase 4.

**Mark TodoWrite todo complete when all signals extracted.**

---

### Phase 6: Narrative Composition (ENHANCED)

**GATE: Create TodoWrite todo: "Phase 6: Compose narrative with inline explanations"**

Final output MUST:
- **PRESERVE ALL DETAILS** — Nothing from source material is too minor to include
- **USE MAXIMUM TOKENS** — Target **1500-2500+ words** (or more if source demands). Brevity is NOT a goal.
- Have **high-density narrative prose** in discussion sections (NOT bullet lists)
- Have **immediate inline explanations** (> 📘) on first occurrence
- Include **Glossary table** for quick lookup
- Have **zero uncorrected phonetic transcriptions**
- Have **counterparty context** in background section

**THE DEFAULT IS COMPREHENSIVE, NOT CONCISE.**

### Word Count Calibration (DYNAMIC)

**Word count MUST scale with source content density, not be a fixed target.**

| Meeting Type | Duration | Target Words | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Quick Sync/Standup** | 10-20 min | 400-800 | Limited decisions, few action items |
| **Standard Meeting** | 30-60 min | 800-1500 | Typical discussion density |
| **Working Session** | 1-2 hours | 1500-2500 | Multiple topics, detailed decisions |
| **Deep Dive/Workshop** | 2-4+ hours | 2500-5000+ | Extensive content, NO UPPER LIMIT |

**The Iron Rule of Word Count:**
```
ZERO DETAIL LOSS > TARGET WORD COUNT
```

- If source has 10 business-relevant points → output covers all 10 (even if only 500 words)
- If source has 100 business-relevant points → output covers all 100 (even if 6000 words)
- **NEVER pad** to reach minimum word count
- **NEVER truncate** to stay under maximum word count

**Anti-Padding Signals (STOP if you catch yourself):**
- Adding generic commentary ("This was an interesting discussion...")
- Repeating the same point in different words
- Over-explaining simple concepts that need no elaboration
- Creating transitions between unrelated topics that don't connect

**Anti-Truncation Signals (STOP if you catch yourself):**
- "I'll summarize this part" ← WRONG
- "This is getting too long" ← WRONG
- "The key points are..." (while skipping non-key points) ← WRONG

---

## Narrative Writing Rules (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Storytelling Tone (MANDATORY)

**You are telling a story, not filing a bureaucratic report.**

The difference between dry documentation and memorable notes is narrative engagement. Write as if you're explaining the meeting to a colleague over coffee—clear, natural, with a sense of unfolding events.

| Aspect | Report Tone (AVOID) | Storytelling Tone (USE) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Opening** | "The meeting covered three topics." | "The conversation opened with a challenge that had been brewing for months." |
| **Transitions** | "Next, Topic B was discussed." | "This realization naturally led to the next question..." |
| **Conclusions** | "The team decided X." | "After weighing the trade-offs, the path forward became clear." |
| **Pacing** | Flat, equal weight to all points | Build tension, then resolution |

**Key techniques:**
- **Temporal flow**: Use "At first... then... eventually..." to create narrative arc
- **Causality emphasis**: Always explain WHY before WHAT
- **Stakes clarity**: Make readers understand what was at risk
- **Resolution satisfaction**: End topics with clear outcomes, not hanging threads

### Metaphor & Analogy (MANDATORY — 1-2 Per Document)

**Every meeting notes MUST include 1-2 metaphors or analogies to crystallize abstract concepts.**

Abstract ideas become concrete through comparison. A well-chosen metaphor compresses paragraphs of explanation into a single memorable image.

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Process metaphor** | "The legacy deployment process acted like a highway toll booth—everything stopped while waiting for approval." |
| **Transition metaphor** | "From gatekeeper to guardrail—no longer blocking the road, but preventing cars from going off the cliff." |
| **Scale metaphor** | "Like turning an ocean liner, the organizational shift was slow but unmistakably directional." |
| **Complexity metaphor** | "The microservices architecture had become a plate of spaghetti—everything touched everything else." |

**Placement rules:**
- Use at the **beginning** of a topic to frame the problem
- OR at the **end** to crystallize the insight
- Never force—if no natural metaphor fits, one is enough

**Selection criteria:**
- Metaphor MUST illuminate, not obscure
- Prefer familiar domains (vehicles, buildings, nature) over niche references
- The metaphor should be quotable—something readers might repeat

### The Flowing Prose Mandate

**Every discussion section MUST be written as connected prose, not bullets.**

| Principle | WRONG (Bullets) | CORRECT (Narrative) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Flow** | "- Philosophy A adopted / - Bottleneck existed" | "[Problem description]. [Why it matters]. [Solution emerged as answer]." |
| **Causality** | "- Tool X limits / - Tool Y developed" | "As [situation changed], [existing approach] reached limits. [Pain points], [decision to change]." |
| **Context** | "- N% complete" | "Instead of [forcing change], [gradual approach]. As a result, [voluntary adoption]. Currently, [measurable outcome]." |

### Narrative Structure Pattern

**Each topic MUST follow this structure:**

```
[Background/Problem: 2-3 sentences] → [Turning Point/Solution: 2-3 sentences] → [Result/Significance: 1-2 sentences]
```

**Structure Template:**
```markdown
### [Insight-Driven Title] — [Subtitle capturing the transformation]

[Problem context - what was the challenge?]
[Why it mattered - scale, impact, pain]

[Solution/turning point - what changed?]
[How it works - key mechanism]
> 📘 **[Term]** — [1-2 sentence definition with source context]

[Transition to next topic - how this led to the next development]
```

### Minimum Sentence Requirements

| Section | Minimum Sentences | Guideline |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Background | 3-5 sentences | Counterparty + meeting purpose + why now |
| Each Topic | 4-8 sentences | Problem → Solution → Result flow |
| Transitions | 1-2 sentences | Connect one topic to the next |

### Connecting Phrases (USE LIBERALLY)

| Category | Phrases |
|----------|---------|
| **Causality** | "As a result", "Consequently", "This led to", "Due to this" |
| **Transition** | "Against this backdrop", "This shift immediately led to", "Success raised the next challenge" |
| **Contrast** | "On the other hand", "However", "Meanwhile" |
| **Emphasis** | "The key point is", "Most importantly", "Particularly noteworthy is" |

### Section Titles (Narrative-Driven)

**WRONG (Generic):**
- "## Discussion Summary"
- "### 1. SRE Organization Structure"

**CORRECT (Insight-Driven):**
- "## Key Learnings"
- "### From Gatekeeper to Guardrail — The SRE Philosophy Shift"
- "### Choice Over Mandate — The Success of Control's Adoption Strategy"

---

## Output Structure (MANDATORY)

```markdown
# [Meeting Title] — YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Date/Time** | YYYY-MM-DD (Day) HH:MM–HH:MM |
| **Location** | [Physical / Video platform / Hybrid] |
| **Our Team** | @name, @name (N people) |
| **Counterparty** | [Company] — name(role), name(role) (N people) |
| **Author** | @name |

---

## Executive Summary

> **For time-pressed readers: 30-second overview of what matters.**

- **What**: [1 sentence - what was discussed/decided]
- **So What**: [1 sentence - why it matters to us]
- **Now What**: [1-2 sentences - immediate next steps]
- **Key Decision(s)**: [Bullet: most critical decision(s) made]
- **Blocker/Risk** (if any): [Bullet: critical blocker or risk identified]

---

## Background

[3-5 sentences integrating counterparty context + meeting purpose]

[If C2C/special format, explain it here with inline term explanation]

---

## Key Learnings

### [Narrative-Driven Title 1]

[4-8 sentences following Problem → Solution → Result pattern]

> 📘 **[Term]** (Original: "[original]") — [1-2 sentence explanation]

[Transition sentence to next topic]

### [Narrative-Driven Title 2]

[Continue narrative flow...]

---

## Implications

| Insight | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| [Insight 1] | [Actionable recommendation] |

---

## Action Items

- [ ] [Verb first] — @owner, Due: MM/DD

---

## Parked Items

- **[Topic]**: [Rejection reason] — Revisit: [condition]

---

## Glossary

| Term | Original | Definition | Context |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| **[Term]** | "[original]" | [Definition] | [Context in this meeting] |

---

## References

- [Source title](URL) — [Brief description]

---

## Next Steps

- [Next action or follow-up meeting]
```

---

## Immediate Inline Explanation Format (CRITICAL)

**Format:**
```markdown
[Narrative sentence mentioning **Term**.]
> 📘 **[Term]** (Original: "[original if STT]") — [1-2 sentence explanation]
```

**Placement Rule:**
- Explain immediately after the term's first appearance
- Placing only at section end or Glossary = WRONG

**WRONG patterns:**
```markdown
<!-- Term without immediate explanation -->
The team uses cdk8s for deployment.
[... 5 paragraphs later ...]
> 📘 **cdk8s** — explanation here

<!-- Bullet list instead of narrative -->
- cdk8s: YAML auto-generation
- IDP: developer platform
```

---

## Red Flags — STOP and Verify

If you catch yourself thinking:

**🚨 DETAIL PRESERVATION (MOST CRITICAL):**
- "This detail is minor, I can skip it" ← Check: Is it a decision, metric, or technical fact? If yes, INCLUDE. Is it pure small talk with no relationship insight? Then skip.
- "Let me summarize this part" ← WRONG. Summarizing = detail loss. Expand, don't compress.
- "This is getting too long" ← WRONG. Length is not a problem. Detail loss is.
- "I'll keep it concise" ← WRONG. Concise = detail loss. Comprehensive is the default.
- "The user probably doesn't need all this" ← WRONG. The user EXPLICITLY wants all business-relevant details preserved.
- "I can combine these points" ← WRONG. Combining often loses nuance. Keep them separate.
- "This quote is too long to include" ← WRONG. Long quotes preserve voice and context. Include them.
- "I'll paraphrase instead of quoting" ← WRONG. Original words carry weight. Quote when possible.
- "This is just small talk" ← Check: Does it reveal relationship dynamics, shared pain, or power structures? If yes, INCLUDE.

**Time & Location:**
- "The date is enough, time doesn't matter"
- "Location wasn't mentioned explicitly"
- "The user didn't provide it" ← CHECK AGAIN

**Counterparty Research:**
- "The company is famous, no need to research" ← Famous ≠ understood. Research anyway (for EXTERNAL meetings).
- "I know this company already" ← Memory is not a source. Search (for EXTERNAL meetings).
- "There's no public info on their team" ← Try harder: tech blogs, conference talks, LinkedIn.
- "This is just an internal meeting" ← Use Internal Alignment Context instead. Still document team roles, dependencies, and decision authority.
- "Internal meetings don't need Phase 2" ← WRONG. They need Internal Alignment Context—just not web searches.

**Terminology:**
- "This term is too common to explain"
- "I can explain this from memory"
- "The glossary at the end is enough"

**Narrative:**
- "Bullet points are easier to read" ← Easier to scan, harder to understand.
- "This is just information listing" ← Information without narrative = no causality.
- "The user wanted it concise" ← **WRONG. DEFAULT IS COMPREHENSIVE.** Concise must be explicitly requested.
- "Adding transitions is fluff" ← Transitions are the connective tissue of understanding.
- "Formal report tone is more professional" ← Bureaucratic ≠ professional. Storytelling engages.
- "Metaphors are unnecessary decoration" ← Metaphors compress complexity into memorable insight.

**Verification:**
- "The transcript is probably accurate" ← STT error rate: 5-15%
- "I know the correct spelling without searching" ← Memory is not a source
- "One source is enough" ← Single source = potential echo

**ALL of these mean: STOP. You are about to produce unresearched, unverified, fragmented, or INCOMPLETE documentation.**

---

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **"It's getting too long"** | **Length is NOT a problem. Detail loss IS.** The default is comprehensive. If the source has 50 business-relevant points, include 50 points. |
| **"Let me keep it concise"** | **Concise = detail loss.** Brevity must be EXPLICITLY requested. Default is maximum detail preservation. |
| **"This detail seems minor"** | **Is it a decision, metric, or technical fact?** Include it. Is it pure phatic communication with no relationship insight? Skip it. |
| **"This is just small talk, skip it"** | **Check relationship signals.** "We had similar problems" = KEEP (shared context). "Nice weather today" = skip. |
| **"I'll summarize this section"** | **Summarizing destroys nuance.** Expand and explain instead of compressing. |
| **"The user can read the original"** | **The user wants a COMPLETE record.** They shouldn't need to cross-reference the source. |
| **"This quote is too long"** | **Long quotes preserve voice and context.** Include them. Original words carry irreplaceable weight. |
| "The counterparty is famous, no research needed" | Famous ≠ understood. Their team size, tech stack, recent announcements add irreplaceable context. 2 minutes of research makes background 10x richer. |
| "Bullet points are easier to scan" | Scanning ≠ understanding. Narrative conveys causality, context, and connection. Bullets convey fragments. |
| "Adding narrative is fluff" | Narrative is structure. "Why → What → How" is not fluff—it's the difference between data and insight. |
| "Formal report tone is more professional" | Bureaucratic tone creates distance. Storytelling tone creates engagement. Professional = clear and memorable. |
| "Metaphors don't belong in meeting notes" | A good metaphor compresses a paragraph into one memorable image. It aids recall and communication. |
| "Time wasn't mentioned" | Check calendar, transcript header, spoken refs. If missing, mark `[TBD]` and ask. |
| "Location doesn't matter for remote" | "Zoom" IS a location. "Company HQ 11th floor" adds context. Document it. |
| "Owner wasn't decided" | Mark `[TBD - needs assignment]` and warn. Action without owner = never done. |
| "This term is standard" | Standard to your team. Foreign to legal, HR, new hires. |
| "Searching each term takes too long" | 30 sec × 10 terms = 5 min. Saves 50+ person-minutes of confusion. |
| "I know what the term means" | Memory may be wrong. Search every time. |
| "The transcript is source of truth" | Transcript is raw input. Your job is verified, narrative output. |
| "STT was probably right" | STT has 5-15% error rate on tech terms. ASSUME errors. |
| "Inline explanations break flow" | They ENABLE flow for newcomers. Accessibility > aesthetics. |

## Key Principles

**THE THREE ABSOLUTES (ALWAYS ON BY DEFAULT):**
- **ZERO BUSINESS-RELEVANT DETAIL LOSS** — Every decision, metric, technical fact, and contextual insight MUST appear. Filter pure phatic communication (small talk) UNLESS it reveals relationship dynamics.
- **DYNAMIC TOKEN UTILIZATION** — Use 400-5000+ words scaled to source content density. Short meeting = short notes. Long workshop = comprehensive notes. NEVER pad. NEVER truncate.
- **HIGH-DENSITY NARRATIVE** — Every sentence carries weight. Tight storytelling, not padding.

**Supporting Principles:**
- **Counterparty context = complete background** — Meeting notes without counterparty research are half-blind
- **Narrative flow = understanding** — Connected sentences convey causality; bullets convey fragments
- **Storytelling tone = engagement** — Write like explaining to a colleague, not filing a bureaucratic report
- **Metaphor = compression** — One good analogy crystallizes paragraphs of abstraction into memorable insight
- **Meeting without time/location = incomplete record** — Always include when and where
- **User-provided context = MUST use** — If user mentions it, it MUST appear in output
- **Action without owner = doesn't exist** — Every action needs @mention
- **Term without IMMEDIATE explanation = friction** — First occurrence, not at end
- **Correction without 2+ sources = guess** — Verify with independent sources
- **Phonetic transcription preserved = unsearchable** — Convert to proper English
- **Memory is not a source** — Search and verify, even for "obvious" terms
- **Comprehensive by default** — Brevity must be EXPLICITLY requested. Default = maximum detail.
- **48-hour rule** — Memory distorts after 48 hours. Distribute same day.

## Integration with Other Skills

**This skill requires:**
- **mcp__time__get_current_time** — REQUIRED for Phase 0
- **Brave Search MCP** — REQUIRED for counterparty research & term verification
- **Context7 MCP** — For technical documentation lookup
- **mcp__fetch__fetch** — For counterparty website/blog content

**Escalate to deep-research when:**
- Counterparty has extensive public presence worth deep-diving
- Term has multiple conflicting definitions
- Meeting topic requires comprehensive market analysis

**After this skill (within 48 hours):**
- **Distribute notes** — Email/Slack to all attendees
- **Track action items** — Create tickets in Jira/Linear/Notion
- **Archive** — Store with naming: `[YYYY-MM-DD] Meeting Title`

---

## Output Language

1. **First Priority**: If `CLAUDE.md` specifies language → use it
2. **Second Priority**: Use language of user's input

Keep technical terms in **proper English** with explanation in target language.
- Correct: **Jenkins** (Original: "jenkinsun", CI/CD automation server)

```markdown
# [Meeting Title] — YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Date/Time** | YYYY-MM-DD (Day) HH:MM–HH:MM KST |
| **Location** | [Physical location / Video platform] |
| **Our Team** | @name (role), @name (N people) |
| **Counterparty** | [Company] — name (role), name (N people) |
| **Author** | @name |

---

## Executive Summary

> **For time-pressed readers: 30-second overview of what matters.**

- **What**: [Brief description of meeting purpose and outcome]
- **So What**: [Why this matters to our team/organization]
- **Now What**: [Immediate actions required]
- **Key Decision(s)**: [Most critical decision(s) made]
- **Blocker/Risk** (if any): [Any critical blocker or risk]

---

## Background

[Sentence 1: Counterparty identity - scale, industry position]
[Sentence 2: Their team structure and why they're relevant]
[Sentence 3: Why this meeting matters to us - gap, learning opportunity]
[Sentence 4: Meeting context - how arranged, format if special]
> 📘 **[Format Term]** — [Definition if meeting format is unfamiliar]

---

## Key Learnings

### [Insight-Driven Title] — [Transformation Subtitle]

[Problem: 2-3 sentences - what challenge existed, why it mattered]

[Solution: 2-3 sentences - what changed, how it works]
> 📘 **[Term]** — [1-2 sentence definition]

[Transition: 1 sentence - how this led to next development]

### [Next Topic Title]

[Continue Problem → Solution → Result pattern...]

---

## Implications

| Insight | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| [Learning 1] | [Actionable next step] |

---

## Action Items

- [ ] [Verb first] — @owner, Due: MM/DD

## Parked Items

- **[Topic]**: [Reason] — Revisit: [condition]

## Glossary

| Term | Original | Definition | Context |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| **[Term]** | "[STT original]" | [Definition] | [Meeting context] |

## Next Steps

- [Follow-up action]
```

## Action

Transform the provided meeting inputs into narrative-driven, actionable notes following this structure.

**REMEMBER — THE THREE ABSOLUTES ARE ALWAYS ON:**
1. **ZERO BUSINESS-RELEVANT DETAIL LOSS** — Every decision, metric, and technical fact MUST be in the output. Filter pure phatic communication unless it reveals relationship dynamics.
2. **DYNAMIC TOKEN UTILIZATION** — 400-5000+ words scaled to source. Short meeting = short notes. Long workshop = comprehensive notes. NEVER pad. NEVER truncate.
3. **HIGH-DENSITY NARRATIVE** — Tight, structured storytelling with substance

**Additional Requirements:**
- Missing counterparty research = incomplete context
- Missing time/location = incomplete record
- Bullet list discussion = fragmented understanding
- Action without owner = failed notes
- Term without immediate inline explanation = inaccessible
- Correction without 2+ sources = misinformation
- Phonetic transcription preserved = unsearchable
- User context ignored = failure to read input
- **Summarized or abbreviated output = FAILURE**
