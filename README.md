## Memory: CLAUDE.md

Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` files as persistent memory:

| Path | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Global (all projects) |
| `./CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific |

The `CLAUDE.md` in this repository root serves as the **global memory** template, defining behavioral rules, MCP server usage patterns, and response preferences.

## Deep Thinking Plugin

This repository is a **Claude Code Plugin Marketplace** containing the `deep-thinking` plugin.

### Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace (one-time setup)
/plugin marketplace add JSON-OBJECT/claude-code

# Install plugin
/plugin install deep-thinking@jsonobject-marketplace

# Restart Claude Code to load the plugin
```

### Commands

#### `/deep-thinking:pulse {topic}` — Trend Radar
> **Before you research, know WHAT to research.**

Scans 5-8 subreddits × 75+ posts to identify what's genuinely hot RIGHT NOW.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Heat Score Formula** | Objective ranking: (Upvotes × 0.4) + (Comments × 0.3) + (Cross-sub × 0.2) + (Recency × 0.1) |
| **News Cross-Validation** | Compares Reddit trends against mainstream news — prevents echo chamber reports |
| **Emerging Signals Watch** | Tracks low-heat topics with rising momentum — tomorrow's headlines today |
| **Actionable Output** | Every issue includes a ready-to-run `/deep-research` query |

**Use before:** `/deep-research` — ensures you research the RIGHT topic, not just any topic.

---

#### `/deep-thinking:deep-research {topic}` — Forensic Tech Audit
> **One-shot research that answers questions before you ask them.**

Conducts 15-20+ searches with mandatory Phase Zero "Unknown Unknowns" discovery.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Phase Zero Protocol** | Questions the question itself — catches terminology confusion, outdated assumptions, missed prerequisites |
| **One-Shot Completeness** | Anticipates 5 follow-up questions ("What is it?" → "How much?" → "Gotchas?" → "Show code" → "Verdict?") and answers ALL in one report |
| **Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu Structure** | Four-act narrative (Setup → Development → Turn → Conclusion) — reads like investigative journalism, not bullet lists |
| **Community + Official Balance** | Reddit/HN sentiment weighted proportionally against official sources — 70% positive / 30% concern = both reported |

**Output:** Publication-ready deep dive that feels like Ars Technica meets Gemini Deep Research.

---

#### `/deep-thinking:forge-prompt {instruction}` — Instruction Smithy
> **Build prompts that resist rationalization.**

Creates bulletproof instructions following the Superpowers philosophy with 9 mandatory components.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Iron Law** | ONE non-negotiable rule that guarantees failure if broken |
| **Red Flags Section** | Mental patterns that signal you're about to fail — "If you catch yourself thinking..." |
| **Rationalization Table** | Preempts every excuse with direct rebuttal — Excuse \| Reality format |
| **Phase Gates** | Clear checkpoints that MUST be passed before proceeding |
| **Strong Language Protocol** | MUST/NEVER/ALWAYS — no soft language ("should", "consider", "try to") |

**Philosophy:** If you think you don't need the structure, you need it most.

---

#### `/deep-thinking:meeting-notes {transcript}` — Narrative Documentation
> **Meeting notes that tell a story, not list fragments.**

Transforms raw transcripts into narrative-driven documentation with 6-phase verification.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Counterparty Intelligence** | External meetings: 3+ searches per counterparty for context (size, tech stack, recent news) |
| **STT Error Correction** | Catches phonetic mishearings ("jenkinsun" → "Jenkins") with 2+ source verification |
| **Immediate Inline Definitions** | Technical terms explained right where they appear (> 📘 format), not buried in glossary |
| **Storytelling Tone + Metaphors** | Mandatory 1-2 metaphors per document — "From gatekeeper to guardrail" style |
| **Zero Detail Loss** | Every business-relevant point preserved — 400-5000+ words scaled to source density |

**Anti-pattern:** Bullet lists. This produces flowing narrative with cause-and-effect reasoning.

---

#### `/deep-thinking:translate-kr {article}` — Korean Transcreation
> **Rewriting in Korean, not converting English structures.**

Transcreates English IT articles into native Korean with terminology verification and 10 anti-artifact rules.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Tier 1/2 Verification** | Established terms: 1 official source / New terms: 2+ sources including community (velog, tistory) |
| **10 Anti-Translation-Artifact Rules** | Pronoun elimination, Passive→Active, Sino-Korean ban, Emotional modifier ban, etc. |
| **Community Standard Priority** | If Korean dev community uses English 70%+ of the time, keep English (Token, Prompt, Fine-tuning) |
| **Code Block Protection** | NEVER modifies content inside code blocks or inline code |

**Key insight:** "Fine-tuning" → "파인튜닝" (community usage), NOT "미세 조정" (textbook translation).

---

#### `/deep-thinking:blog-cover {title and concept}` — Creative Director for Gemini
> **Anti-AI-looking blog covers that make readers curious.**

Generates image prompts for Gemini Nano Banana Pro with 6-phase visual storytelling.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Visual Metaphor First** | Every cover starts with an unexpected analogy — "Kubernetes = postal worker sorting containers" |
| **Chain-of-Thought Composition** | Explicit 9-grid spatial positioning — asymmetry always, center composition = AI tell |
| **Anti-AI Armor** | Mandatory "Avoid" section with 8+ items (symmetry, HDR, plastic textures, generic tech imagery) |
| **Imperfection Keywords** | 2-3 required: "visible brushstrokes", "analog film grain", "slightly uneven lines" |
| **Title Typography Mandatory** | Every prompt includes title overlay specifications — covers without title = incomplete |

**Artist references:** Christoph Niemann, Saul Steinberg, The New Yorker editorial style.
